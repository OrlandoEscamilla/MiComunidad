This is not entirely the production version, some changes has been made for security reasons. You can review, use or make changes for your own. 

## Introduction

This is the first non-comercial and personal project I release. The purpose of this was to give to my College's community a platform where they can find useful information about our Institute. We as developers need to show our work, so the main reason was I need to learn more and I think the best way of doing it is making something valuable not just for me, but for people.

## Technologies

This project was made using:
- PHP (Backend)
- JavaScript (UX)
- Material Desing / Bootstrap Library (UI)
- MariaDB (DB engine)
- OneSignal (Push Notifications Service)

Another SDK or libraries implemented are:
- jQuery
- PHPMailer
- Facebook Login
- Google Login
- Google Captcha


**Also the API service has been tested with an Android App (native)**

## What else it needs?

- Changing the project to a MVC PHP Framework would become it better
- The API needs to be rewritten to use OOP, also for a better handling of requests/responses
